# Google Health — read-only data extractor

Read your **Google Health** data from any agent. This is a generic, **read-only** client
for the Google Health v4 API: it authenticates, pulls data points for any data type, and
prints **JSON**. It does no filtering, merging, or interpretation — you get the data and
parse whatever you care about. Single static binary — **no Python or other runtime**.

> ⚠️ **Read-only.** It requests only read-only Google Health scopes and never writes your
> health data.

> 🔒 **Privacy — sensitive health data leaves on stdout.** Every `data list`, `rollup daily`,
> `sessions`, and `api get` prints your **personal health information** (heart rate, sleep, weight,
> exercise, blood oxygen, profile, …) to **stdout** as JSON. In an agent or pipeline, stdout may be
> **logged, summarized, persisted, or transmitted** to other tools, model providers, or third
> parties. Treat this output as sensitive PII: only run it in contexts you trust to handle health
> data, and do not persist or forward it unless you intend to. The tool never sends your data
> anywhere itself (it only talks to Google's API over HTTPS) — what happens to stdout is the
> caller's responsibility.

> 🧭 **Data minimization & consent.** Request only the **data types** and the **narrowest time
> window** you actually need (`--days`/`--date`/`--from`/`--to`, not `--all`); prefer the typed
> `data`/`rollup`/`sessions` commands over `api get`; and don't persist or forward the output beyond
> the task at hand. Run this only against an account whose owner has **knowingly consented** to
> having their health data read by this agent — the one-time `auth login` is the owner consenting to
> *read-only access for the tool*, not consent for a downstream agent to collect, retain, or transmit
> that data more broadly.

> 🩺 **`doctor` prints local environment metadata.** The `doctor` JSON includes your
> **token-cache and config file paths**, the configured **account** (`user`), and the API
> **base URL** — local filesystem layout and account identifiers rather than health data, but
> still **local environment metadata** that an agent or pipeline may log, forward, or persist.
> It exists to diagnose *your own* setup; treat its output like any other local path/account
> detail and don't paste it into untrusted contexts.

## Setup (one time)

Unlike a simple email/password tool, Google Health uses OAuth, so first-time setup needs a
human in a browser **once**. After that it runs headless (the token auto-refreshes).

1. **Install** the binary:
   ```bash
   # A) Download a release for your OS/arch and put it on PATH:
   #    https://github.com/stozo04/google-health-cli/releases
   # B) Or with Go (1.25+):
   go install github.com/stozo04/google-health-cli/cmd/google-health-cli@latest
   ```
2. **Create a Google Cloud OAuth client** (Desktop app, read-only Health scopes, ~10 min,
   no fees). Full walkthrough: the repo's **OAUTH_SETUP.md**.
3. **Provide the client** via `GOOGLE_HEALTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_HEALTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
   (or a `config.json` with those keys in the working directory).
4. **Authorize once** (opens a browser, asks a human to consent to read-only access):
   ```bash
   google-health-cli auth login
   google-health-cli doctor        # expect "tokenValid": true
   ```
   The token is cached `0600` and auto-refreshed; every later run is headless.

## Credentials

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_HEALTH_CLIENT_ID` | ✓ | OAuth client ID (Desktop app) |
| `GOOGLE_HEALTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | ✓ | OAuth client secret |
| `GOOGLE_HEALTH_CONFIG` | — | Path to a `config.json` holding the above instead |
| `GOOGLE_HEALTH_TOKEN_CACHE` | — | Override the cached-token path |
| `GOOGLE_HEALTH_BASE_URL` | — | Override the API base URL |

`config.json` (gitignored) is an alternative to the env vars:

```json
{
  "client_id": "PASTE_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "PASTE_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

> 🔑 **Protect your credentials.** The OAuth `client_id`/`client_secret` and the cached **token**
> are sensitive secrets stored on disk in plaintext (`config.json` / `token.json`, written `0600`).
> They're gitignored — keep it that way: never commit them, copy them into a shared folder, back them
> up to an untrusted location, or paste them into logs or chat. Rotate the OAuth client (and run
> `auth logout`) if one may have leaked.

## Commands

### Discover the data types

```bash
google-health-cli types list                 # all types ( * = supports list )
google-health-cli types describe heart-rate   # one type's record shape, scope, time field
```

### Read data points (the core)

```bash
google-health-cli data list heart-rate --days 1        # last 1 day
google-health-cli data list sleep --days 14             # last 14 days
google-health-cli data list daily-resting-heart-rate --days 30
google-health-cli data list steps --date 2026-06-16     # one civil day
google-health-cli data list weight --from 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z --to 2026-07-01T00:00:00Z
google-health-cli data list distance --all              # everything, no time filter
```

stdout is **always a JSON array of the raw data points** (verbatim from the API); a one-line
count goes to stderr. Window flags (precedence: `--all` > `--from`/`--to` > `--date`/`--days`):
`--date today|yesterday|YYYY-MM-DD`, `--days N` (default 7), `--from`/`--to` (RFC3339, together),
`--all` (no filter).

Example (`data list daily-resting-heart-rate`):

```json
[
  {
    "dataSource": { "platform": "FITBIT", "device": { "displayName": "Google Pixel Watch 4 (45mm)" } },
    "dailyRestingHeartRate": { "date": { "year": 2026, "month": 6, "day": 17 }, "beatsPerMinute": "78" }
  }
]
```

A few types are roll-up/reconcile-only and can't be `list`ed (`types list` marks listable ones
with `*`); read those with `rollup daily <type>` instead (below).

### Daily roll-ups (server-side totals)

```bash
google-health-cli rollup daily steps --days 7           # one reconciled total per civil day
google-health-cli rollup daily active-minutes --days 7   # a roll-up-only type (no `data list`)
```

`rollup daily <type>` returns the API's **daily roll-up** rows — one value per civil (local)
calendar day — instead of the raw per-minute/per-sample points `data list` returns. It's the cheap
way to get daily totals (e.g. a `steps` total per day rather than a per-minute dump) and the **only**
way to read the roll-up-only types that have no `list` op (`active-minutes`, `total-calories`,
`floors`, `calories-in-heart-rate-zone`, `time-in-heart-rate-zone`). stdout is a JSON array of the
raw roll-up rows; an `N <type> daily rollup(s)` count goes to stderr. Each value is **reconciled
across data sources** (and excludes off-wrist intervals), so it is *not* a naive sum of `data list`
points. Window flags mirror `data list` minus `--all` (the range is required).

```json
[
  {
    "civilStartTime": { "date": { "year": 2026, "month": 6, "day": 16 }, "time": {} },
    "civilEndTime":   { "date": { "year": 2026, "month": 6, "day": 17 }, "time": {} },
    "steps": { "countSum": "8000" }
  }
]
```

### Parsed exercise sessions (convenience)

```bash
google-health-cli sessions --days 14 --json    # flattened exercise rows
google-health-cli sessions --raw               # raw exercise data points
```

```json
[
  { "date": "2026-06-16", "exercise_type": "ELLIPTICAL", "duration_min": 35,
    "avg_hr": 130, "calories": 236, "platform": "FITBIT" }
]
```

`sessions` returns **all** exercise types (no filtering); the caller keeps what it wants.

### Raw read-only API access

```bash
google-health-cli api get /v4/users/me/profile     # GET any read-only v4 path
google-health-cli api get /v4/users/me/settings
```

> ⚠️ **Sensitive endpoints — broader than the typed metrics.** `api get` can read **any**
> read-only v4 path, including `users/me/profile` and `users/me/settings` — account, identity, and
> settings data that the typed commands don't surface. Its responses are personal data printed to
> stdout, so the same **Privacy** caution above applies, and the broad reach makes
> over-collection easy. It stays **GET-only** (no path can write or delete), but prefer the typed
> `data`/`rollup`/`sessions` commands and reach for `api get` only when you need an endpoint they
> don't model.

## Full command reference

| Command | What it does | `--json` |
|---|---|---|
| `auth login \| logout \| status` | OAuth login (one-time browser), token mgmt | `status` |
| `doctor` | Config + token validity; reports `configFound`/`clientIdLoaded` and exits non-zero (78) when no config / no `client_id` is found, else 2 if not authed | always |
| `types list \| describe <type>` | Inspect the data-type catalog (no network) | ✓ |
| `data list <type>` | List data points for a type (always JSON) | n/a (always) |
| `rollup daily <type>` | Server-side daily totals, reconciled per civil day | n/a (always) |
| `sessions [--days N] [--raw]` | Parsed exercise sessions (convenience) | ✓ |
| `api get <path>` | Raw read-only GET of any v4 path | n/a |
| `config show \| path` | Inspect resolved config (`client_secret` masked) | `show` |
| `version` | Build metadata (also `--version`) | ✓ |
| `completion <shell>` | Shell completion (bash/zsh/fish/powershell) | — |

## Conventions

- **stdout is parseable**; human hints, counts, and logs go to **stderr**, never interleaved.
- **Exit codes:** `0` success, `2` auth/API failure (incl. `doctor` when unauthenticated),
  `64` usage error (incl. an expired token with no OAuth client credentials to refresh it),
  `78` config error. An expired token plus an undiscoverable/credential-less config fails fast
  with an actionable message — not the cryptic `oauth2 "Could not determine client ID"` error.
- **Read-only:** six read-only `googlehealth.*.readonly` scopes; no write operations exist.
- **Secrets:** `config.json` and the token cache are gitignored — never commit them.
- **Time-filter formats** are handled for you per data type (civil wall-clock, RFC3339
  instant, or date-only). If a type rejects server-side filtering, re-run with `--all`.

See the repo's **AGENTS.md** for the exact `--json` shapes and exit-code contract.
